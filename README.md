- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gabrielaribeirocampestre

- I'm 19 years old, I'm from Campestre-MG, I'm studying Computer Science at the institution PUC Minas in PoÃ§os de Caldas and this is my profile on Github!
-No matter how tired you are, never stop studying! Studying is a privilege and only your personal effort will lead you to meet people and worlds 
that the accommodated will never know!
