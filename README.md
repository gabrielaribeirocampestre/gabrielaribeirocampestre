- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gabrielaribeirocampestre

- I'm 23 years old, originally from Campestre-MG and currently living in Campinas-SP, Brazil. I hold a degree in Computer Science from PUC Minas and work as a Junior Systems Analyst at PUC-Campinas.

I believe knowledge has the power to transform lives â€” studying is a privilege, and it's through continuous effort that we create opportunities and reach places that many give up on along the way.
